## Car Rental Example
This is a final I did in high school for a web development course. The course was mostly centered around PHP and CSS, but I asked my teacher if I could do something more advanced with Next.js to learn about SEO, SPA, and React. The website is very quick and dynamically adjusts to different screen sizes.
